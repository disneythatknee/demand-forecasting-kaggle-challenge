# Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge by Kaggle


This project applies deep learning (Keras) and feature engineering techniques to forecast product demand using a Kaggle retail dataset.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and merged training/test datasets, handled missing values, and created time-based features (lags, rolling windows, day-of-week, month).
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualized demand trends with Seaborn/Matplotlib, identifying seasonal and cyclical patterns.
- **Methodologies Analyzed**: XGBoost, ARIMA/SARIMA, Prophet, and Keras deep learning models.
- **Modeling**: Implemented Keras neural networks for time-series prediction, with tuned hyperparameters for accuracy and robustness.
- **Results**: Improved forecast performance through engineered features and tested on hold-out data.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Keras, TensorFlow.
